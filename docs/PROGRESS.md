## 2026-10-27, Claude Code (Opus 5.5): environment set-up

- Installed and verified: Flutter 3.47.8 (Dart 3.13.7) at `C:\dev\flutter`, Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 17.14 (C++ desktop), Microsoft OpenJDK 17.0.19, Android SDK (platform 36, build-tools 36.0.0, platform-tools, NDK r28c fetched by Gradle). Windows Developer Mode enabled (symlinks for plugins).
- `flutter doctor`: Windows, Android and Visual Studio all OK.
- Smoke test of a throwaway `flutter create` app: `flutter build windows --debug` and `flutter build apk --debug` both succeeded.
- Repo created at `C:\dev\attenlume`. Brand kit merged into `assets/`, `design/` and `docs/`. No Flutter project yet, so no tests to run.
- Overnight supervisor added (`tool/overnight.ps1`, `tool/agent-prompt.md`).
